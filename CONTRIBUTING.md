# Contributing
If you haven't already read through them, we recommend the starting with the [Azure contribution guidelines][azure-oss].

We will _consider_ any contributions that align with the stated goals of the project.

## Legal
You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

Please submit a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.azure.com/) before submitting a pull request. This process is automated and should be painless.

## Housekeeping
Your pull request should:

* Include a description of what your change intends to do.
* Be based on a reasonably recent commit in the `master` branch.
* Include tests covering your changes _as appropriate_.

## Be nice
We might be slower than you'd like. We might also ask you to make changes to the pull request. We ask for your patience.  :smiley:
